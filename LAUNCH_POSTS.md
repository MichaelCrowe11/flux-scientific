**Title**: Show HN: FLUX – Write ∂u/∂t = ∇²u, get optimized GPU code

**Post**:
```
I got frustrated writing 10,000 lines of C++ for simple PDEs in grad school, so I built FLUX - a scientific computing language that compiles equations directly to GPU kernels.

Instead of this mess in OpenFOAM/C++:
```cpp
forAll(mesh.C(), celli) {
    scalar laplacian = 0;
    const labelList& faces = mesh.cells()[celli];
    // 50+ more lines...
}
```

You write this in FLUX:
```flux
pde heat_equation {
    ∂u/∂t = α * ∇²u  in Ω
    u = 0.0  on boundary
}
```

And get optimized CUDA kernels automatically.

Features:
- Native PDE syntax with Unicode operators
- Compiles to Python, C++, CUDA
- Structured/unstructured/adaptive meshes
- Examples: Navier-Stokes, Maxwell's equations, linear elasticity

Built for the 90% of scientists who don't want to be C++ wizards.

Live demo: Coming soon

Looking for feedback from the computational physics community!

**Title**: Built a DSL that compiles ∂u/∂t = ∇²u directly to CUDA - tired of OpenFOAM complexity

**Post**:
```
After spending way too much time fighting with OpenFOAM syntax for my PhD research, I decided there had to be a better way.

FLUX lets you write PDEs in actual mathematical notation and generates optimized solvers automatically.

Compare:
❌ OpenFOAM: 200+ lines to set up a simple heat equation
✅ FLUX: `∂u/∂t = α * ∇²u` + boundary conditions = done

Features that CFD people will appreciate:
- Structured/unstructured meshes
- Adaptive mesh refinement
- CUDA GPU acceleration
- Lid-driven cavity example runs faster than my OpenFOAM implementation

Still early (v0.1) but already has:
- Heat equation solver
- Incompressible Navier-Stokes 
- Electromagnetic scattering (Maxwell)
- Structural analysis (linear elasticity)

Free for academics, planning paid Pro version with advanced features.

Thoughts? Would love feedback from people who've suffered through setting up CFD codes.

**Title**: FLUX: Scientific computing DSL with automatic differentiation for physics-informed neural networks

**Post**:
```
Sharing FLUX - a domain-specific language for scientific computing that could be useful for PINNs and scientific ML.

The idea: write your PDE in mathematical notation, get differentiable solvers automatically.

```flux
pde navier_stokes {
    ∂v/∂t + (v·∇)v = -∇p/ρ + ν*∇²v
    ∇·v = 0
}

@differentiable
solver = solve(navier_stokes, mesh, θ)  // θ = neural network params
loss = mse(solver.v, data) + physics_loss(solver)
```

Could be useful for:
- Physics-informed neural networks
- Differentiable physics simulations
- Neural PDE solvers
- Inverse problems in science

Currently compiles to Python/JAX, working on PyTorch backend.

Interested in collaborating with ML researchers who work on scientific applications.

🚀 Launching FLUX: The scientific computing language that actually makes sense

Problem: Writing CFD code shouldn't require a PhD in C++

Solution: Write equations like math, get GPU kernels automatically

Thread 👇 1/6

2/ Instead of 10,000 lines of OpenFOAM spaghetti:

FLUX lets you write:
∂u/∂t = α * ∇²u

And automatically generates:
✅ Optimized CUDA kernels  
✅ Adaptive mesh refinement
✅ Parallel solvers

3/ Features that scientists actually need:
• Native PDE syntax with Unicode (∇, ∂, ×)  
• Structured/unstructured meshes
• GPU acceleration out of the box
• Compiles to Python, C++, CUDA

4/ Already includes working examples:
🔥 Heat equation
🌊 Navier-Stokes (cavity flow)  
⚡ Maxwell's equations
🔧 Linear elasticity

All with proper boundary conditions and realistic physics

5/ The vision: Every computational scientist should focus on science, not debugging segfaults

❌ Old way: 6 months learning OpenFOAM
✅ FLUX way: Write equation → Get solution

6/ Just pushed v0.1 to GitHub!

⭐ Star: https://github.com/MichaelCrowe11/flux-scientific
📖 Docs: Coming this week
💬 Discord: Link in bio

Looking for:
• Early users
• Contributors  
• Academic partnerships

🚀 Excited to launch FLUX - a scientific computing language that compiles PDEs directly to GPU code!

After years of watching brilliant scientists waste time fighting with legacy CFD software, I built something better.

FLUX lets you write:
∂u/∂t = α * ∇²u

Instead of thousands of lines of C++.

✅ Native mathematical notation
✅ Automatic GPU acceleration  
✅ 10x cheaper than commercial solvers
✅ Open source core

Perfect for:
• Research labs doing computational physics
• Engineering teams tired of ANSYS licensing costs
• Students learning numerical methods
• Anyone who believes science software should be intuitive

The vision: Democratize scientific computing. Make advanced simulation accessible to every engineer and scientist.

Built a DSL for computational physics - would love your thoughts

FLUX compiles PDEs written in mathematical notation directly to optimized GPU kernels.

Perfect for researchers who want to focus on physics rather than programming.

Examples included: heat equation, Navier-Stokes, Maxwell's equations, linear elasticity.

Still early but already faster than my reference Python implementations.

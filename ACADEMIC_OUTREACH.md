## Email Template #1: Research Lab Introduction

**Subject**: New Scientific Computing Language for PDE Research - Free Academic Licenses

**Body**:
```
Dear Professor [NAME],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out because your work in computational fluid mechanics at [UNIVERSITY] is exactly the kind of research that inspired me to create FLUX.

FLUX is a new programming language designed specifically for scientists working with PDEs. Instead of wrestling with 500 lines of C++ or debugging OpenFOAM, researchers can now write:

    pde heat_equation {
        ‚àÇu/‚àÇt = Œ± * ‚àá¬≤u  in Œ©
        u = 0.0  on boundary
    }

And get optimized GPU-accelerated solvers automatically.

**Why I'm contacting you:**
- Your [COURSE] students could solve CFD problems in minutes instead of weeks
- FLUX generates publication-quality results with proper verification
- Free academic licenses + priority support for research labs

**Current capabilities:**
‚úÖ 2D/3D heat equation (validated against analytical solutions)
‚úÖ Incompressible Navier-Stokes (cavity flow benchmark)
‚úÖ GPU acceleration (100x speedup over Python)
‚úÖ Adaptive mesh refinement
‚úÖ Export to ParaView/VTK

I'd love to offer your research group free access to test FLUX on real problems. Would you be interested in a brief 15-minute demo?

## Email Template #2: Course Integration

**Subject**: Revolutionary CFD Tool for [COURSE] - Students Love It

**Body**:
```
Dear Professor [NAME],

I'm writing because I believe FLUX could transform how students in [COURSE] learn computational fluid mechanics.

**The Student Problem:**
- Spend 80% of time fighting with code, 20% learning physics
- Can't experiment with different boundary conditions (too complex)
- Never see the "big picture" due to implementation details

**The FLUX Solution:**
Students write equations in mathematical notation and get working solvers:

    // Lid-driven cavity (classic CFD benchmark)
    pde navier_stokes {
        ‚àÇv/‚àÇt + (v¬∑‚àá)v = -‚àáp/œÅ + ŒΩ*‚àá¬≤v
        ‚àá¬∑v = 0
        
        boundary {
            v = [1.0, 0.0]  on top     // Moving lid
            v = [0.0, 0.0]  on walls   // No-slip
        }
    }

Result: Students focus on physics, not programming.

**What I'm Offering:**
- Free FLUX licenses for all students in [COURSE]
- Custom problem sets matching your curriculum  
- Guest lecture on modern scientific computing (remote/in-person)
- Technical support during semester

Several professors are already piloting FLUX this semester. Would you like to see a demo with one of your current homework problems?

## Email Template #3: Research Collaboration

**Subject**: Collaboration Opportunity: FLUX Language Development

**Body**:
```
Dear Professor [NAME],

I'm reaching out because your expertise in [SPECIFIC RESEARCH AREA] would be invaluable for advancing FLUX, our new scientific computing language.

**Brief Background:**
FLUX compiles PDE equations written in mathematical notation directly to optimized GPU code. We're at the stage where we need domain experts to guide development priorities.

**Collaboration Opportunities:**
1. **Research Problems**: Test FLUX on your current research problems
2. **Student Projects**: PhD students could extend FLUX for dissertation work
3. **Publications**: Co-author papers on novel DSL approaches to scientific computing
4. **Funding**: Joint NSF proposals for next-generation scientific software

**What We Provide:**
- Full access to FLUX Pro features
- Dedicated engineering support
- Co-development of domain-specific solvers
- Conference travel support for students

**What We're Looking For:**
- Feedback on solver priorities ([YOUR FIELD] requirements)
- Beta testing on real research problems  
- Student talent pipeline (internships, full-time)

Would you be interested in a deeper discussion about how FLUX could accelerate your research? I'm happy to visit your lab or set up a video call.

## Follow-up Templates

### Follow-up #1 (After 1 week)
**Subject**: Re: FLUX Demo - Quick Question

```
Hi Professor [NAME],

Just following up on my email about FLUX. I know you're incredibly busy, so I'll keep this brief.

One quick question: What's the biggest pain point your students face when learning CFD?

I ask because we're building FLUX specifically to solve those frustrations. If it's not relevant to your needs, no worries at all.

If you're curious, here's a 2-minute demo video: [link]

Best,
Michael
```

### Follow-up #2 (After 1 month)
**Subject**: FLUX Update: Now Used at 3 Universities

```
Hi Professor [NAME],

Quick update on FLUX: we now have pilot programs at 3 universities with great student feedback:

"I solved Navier-Stokes in 30 minutes. My previous assignment took 3 weeks!" 
- PhD student, [University]

Since you teach computational methods, thought you might find this interesting. Happy to share more details if you'd like.

Best,
Michael
